Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I was recommended to use these bottles by a girlfriend who had used them with her baby and sworn by them. I started with a set of 4oz bottles with newborn nipples (#1) and have graduated now to the 9oz bottles with the next size up nipples (#2). I will simply buy new nipples when she's ready for the next step. I am absolutely thrilled with these bottles.  I do have an occasional leak but it is always my own fault for not screwing the lid on tight enough!I have not had any problems with leaking when I have them put together correctly. They were especially good for going back and forth between breast feeding and bottle feeding. My now 4mos old baby never had any difficulties feeding either way and transitioned very smoothly. One reader referred to air being pushed into the bottle during feeding and causing her baby to swallow air. The air wooshing in is a good thing! It prevents a vacuum from developing inside the bottle and allows the baby to continuously feed without having to stop to relieve the pressure inside the bottle. The only time I ever had any problems with mine swallowing air was when she had pretty much outgrown the newborn nipples and would try to suck too hard when she was very hungry. This was immediately corrected by buying the next size up. They're also very easy to clean and can be effectively washed in the dishwasher because of their wide neck. Regular bottles cannot. I, out of necessity, used another brand of bottle with her today at a relative's house and was reminded why I like Avent bottles so much!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"If I had not been given a ton of Avent bottles, I would have chosen some other system.  The leaking is terrible!!!  You have to buy the disks separately, you should get them for free because they are absolutely essential.  The only way to mix formula in the bottle or transport liquid is to use the disks in the ring, then switch to the nipple when you are ready to feed.  The only reason I give it a two is because I do like that you can pump directly into the bottle with the ISIS breast pump.  And, I like the sippy cups.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Leaks! Especially difficult to get a tight seal if you use one hand (while holding baby). A much better design is the Breast Flow Learning Curve First Years bottles. Instead buy The First Years 3pk. Breastflow 5oz. Bottles These worked much better for me.,1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using the Avent bottle system for six months and have been completely satisfied. I introduced an Avent bottle to my daughter at four weeks old and she transitioned easily between breast and bottle. She is still breastfed in the morning and evenings but receives an Avent bottle at daycare and has never had a problem. I have never had a bottle leak of which other consumers have complained. I would recommend this system to any parent, especially those of part-time breastfed babies.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used Avent bottles with my son when he was two weeks old. We only used them on the rare occasion I wasn't available to nurse him (first time was a funeral!). He NEVER had a problem latching on the bottle nipple, and then back to me when I got home. Expressing milk and having Dad, Grandma and Grandpa give him bottles now and then was nice for everyone involved. I can't recall a single time the bottle leaked as others complained. Perhaps it's not the brand that was the problem but the individual nipple or bottle. Also, he was used to working harder at my breast to get milk, but never seemed to get too much from the bottle, no matter how hard he sucked. Again, maybe it was that particular nipple, not the whole brand. Anyway, I loaned all of my Avents to my friend when he adopted a newborn. She's an Avent Girl all the way! Now that my second child is on the way, I'm registering for more!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are simply the best out there. I know, I tried ""ALL"" of them.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I purchased these bottles for my older baby who drinks more than 9 oz at night.  These work well for us because we don't have to refill them as often and the nipples work on his trainer sippy cups from avent.,4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After reading the reviews of these bottles leaking, I personally found a way to keep from it.  When heating in the express bottle heater (after being in the fridge), I loosen the top of the bottle to let the pressure out.  After its ready, I then take the whole top off, wipe off the condensation on the rim (inside and out), then screw on snug, but not real tight.  It solves the leaking problem.  Another review I read said that screwing on too tight also causes leakage.  Ive not had a leaking problem since I started doing this.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I really wanted to like these bottles because they are wide and they don't have any funny parts. But these things leak and leak. What a shame.,1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had started with these bottles.  Then I called AVENT, and they told me these bottles contain BPA.  I switched to the Tempo Liner bottles and they work just as well.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent system works great!  We have never has air/gas issues, and our daughter has never experienced nipple confusion.  We had to introduce the bottle at four days old and went back to the breast at one month without issue.  The nipples can be used on the sippy cups, the nipples can be replaced with storage inserts.  I use these bottles to tote food and to freeze homemade food.  I like the various number of hole nipples you can buy.  This is an excellent bottle!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these for my daughter. I have been using them since she was born, but I have had (like a lot of other people) trouble with them leaking. I have had so many problems with leaks that I am considering not using them for my next child. Sometime the only way to fix the leak is to take the nipple out of the ring and run water over it. As you can imagine, this is not very helpful when we are away from home. I have tried to just not screw them down as tight, but it doesn't always work.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are terrible~once you get comfy with baby and start feeding~they leak all over, then you & baby are soaked (and smelly~especially when on whole milk) and no longer relaxed.  Terrible!!!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had been afraid that my breastfed baby would prefer the bottle once I started pumping. Instead, we found that he did not like the bottle at all. We had received a free sample of the Avent bottle, and discovered that he liked the nipple much more than the ones on the Medela nursing set that goes with my breast pump. He still would much rather get the real thing, but daddy finds it much easier to feed him with the Avent bottle. My one concern is that the plastic is much more rigid than that of the Medela set...am afraid of dropping over hard surface.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Avent bottles are the closest to mother's breast as far as the nipples and the shape and quanity it holds is great. It is very easy to pump breast milk into. I have tried other bottles but i keep coming back to Avent they are the best. All Avent products are superior to all others.Mom of 2 children and one on the wayI will only use Avent for my kids.ThanksAna Soto, New York",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I'm not a big fan of these bottles.  I think they let too much air into my baby's belly.  I think they are generally over rated.  I do however have to stick up for them.  They do not leak if put together correctly.  The most important thing is to make sure that they are completely dry before putting them together.  If there are wet at all they will leak.  Also you have to make sure you have the nipple fully pulled through the cap.,3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I love these bottles! I haven't had any problems with leakage as I did with other brands, and I just love how Avent makes other products too. I have the bottles, sterilizer and the breast pump and I love them all!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles for my first child 2 years ago and loved them then.  Now with my newborn, they are still like new, and I still love them.  I breastfeed her, but she takes one bottle a day without a problem.  Yes, if the white rim is screwed on too tightly, they will leak.  Simply check before feeding.  I've really enjoyed using there entire feeding system from bottles to sippy cups to sterilizer.  Very well made products.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"i was pumping for my daughter when she was born and used these bottles and they were great for storage and easy conversion to a bottle, however the milk leaked out of her mouth all over the place and breast milk is precious. i wasted alot and ended up switching to another bottle. also the flow was too slow on the stage 1 and too fast on stage 2 for her as a newborn. it took almost 25min for her to finish 3-4oz. while it only took 10 or so with a standard bottle. Easy for starge to bottle conversion though.i do not recomend these bottles.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"You turn the cap less or you make it tight,No matter how you try, you wont get it right.You think they drank four, but they only got three,Because below their mouths, the bottle's on a leaking spree.The thing is going to leak, screw it as you might.Who needs this aggravation, at 3 in the night.Warm milk or cold milk, no matter what it holds,Its gonna leak out and seep into their neck folds.You'll need a calibrated wrench, from the Institute of Measures,Who needs these leaky hassles, to feed their little treasures.Each time I use them now, I end up swearing,Many have leaked similar complaints, how can Avent be so uncaring?",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have used both the 4 oz. and the 9 oz. bottles to feed my 3 month old son, and the bottles are so leaky!  The problem seems to have gotten progressively worse over time because now they leak to the point that I'm not sure how much my son is ingesting and how much is soaking his bib and burp cloth.  I tried adjusting the nipple and tightening or loosening the collar - nothing has stopped the leakage.  I have switched to Gerber New Traditions bottles with no problem so far.  I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because the nipple shape is very similar to the real thing, and that's always a plus for someone who wants to combine bottle and breastfeeding.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"As a mother of four, I have tried just about everything out there in the way of bottles.  Now I have a 5 week old daughter and she loves the Avent bottles.  I have never had an issue with nipple confusion.  She also uses the Avent paci's.  No problems at all with going from breast to bottle to binky.  I have read other posts about the bottles leaking or not getting any flow from the nipples.  I hate to say it but these posters are not using the products properly.  If I were exclusively bottle feeding this child, like I did the others, I would completely understand about sleepy 3am bottle woes.  However a simple remedy would be to put them all together after they have been washed.  Why would anyone wait until baby is hungry to put the nipple into the ring?  I think some people are just asking for more work.  That being said, I am now a die-hard Avent fan and use many of their products.  I hope others will do the same!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My son has reflux so we have an ongoing battle with spit up in our house. When I stopped breast feeding I tried a couple different types of bottles and eventually ended up sticking with Dr. Brown's because they helped the most with his gas and spit up. After 3 months of washing all of the parts that Dr. Brown's bottles have, I decided to try Avent. I like the bottles, they are made of a good quality material and they are wide, which made it really easy for me to mix formula in them. My son didn't have a problem latching on or anything, and his gas didn't get any worse, but his spit up became out of control!!!! He began spitting up twice as much as he did on the Dr. Brown's bottles. I was forced to switch back to Dr. Brown's because I just couldn't handle changing his clothes and mine 5 times a day. So they just didn't work for my baby. However, I never had a problem with them leaking...they are pretty good bottles!",3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Since I knew I wouldn't be breastfeeding after returning to work, I began researching bottles before my daughter was born.  Avent bottles received great reviews and now I know why.  The transition from nursing to bottles was a breeze thanks to the patented design of the Avent nipples.  My daughter never developed nipple confusion and never once rejected feeding from the bottle.  The Avent bottles with the wider neck are easier to clean and the Avent sterilizing system makes them even easier to sterilize.  I recommend this product to any mother who wants whats next to best when it comes to feeding their newborn.  Of course, nursing is the number one method.  The only reason why I didn't rate this product a 5 star product is because the bottles are unusually wide.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The only drawback I've seen to these bottles is they sometimes leak and the nipples are too tall to fit in the top of my nipple washer for the dishwasher.  Other than that, it's great!  I do recommend getting some of the &quot;older&quot; nipples as my daughter got frustrated with the bottle with a newborn nipple on it as she got older.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I started using these bottles prior to going back to work, wanting a bottle similar to the (...).  My daughter took the nipple, no problem.  I didn't have a problem with leaks...as everyone else noted, you just screw the nipple ring on lightly and assemble the nipple and ring while wet...that's all it takes.  I do however have a problem now with terrible gas build up in the evenings and gas noises that make my husband blush!!! .  You moms know the screams of a baby with gas build-up...it's awful.  I had been using gas drops, but wanted a solution and not a quick fix. I switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles and she hasn't had the painful gas since!!!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The appearance and size are nice, but these bottles cost too much to have them leaking all over you when you are trying to feed your baby. They are not worth the money because they leak way too much.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"OK first they are easy to clean.  Second the nipples DO NOT collapse. Third, they cut down on bubbles.  Sometimes they leak, but thats easy to cure...DONT SCREW EM ON SOOOO TIGHT!  LOL....buy em, you wont go wrong!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent bottles leak terribly.  I would not recommend buying them to anyone.  It is hard enough waking up in the middle of the night to feed, but add in getting all wet (me and baby).  It isn't just me who has had this problem, which I initially thought.  I have asked several people if this has happened to them and it has.  We've even tried purchasing new nipples, thinking it was that, and it didn't matter.  The bottles seem to have a defect, according to a friend who used to use them years ago and NEVER had the problem then (but NOW does).",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened.  There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues.  I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them.  Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues.  When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well.  I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls.  In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating.  I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.,1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These were the only bottles I ever gave to my baby, so I'm not sure if she would have liked something better, but she seems to really like them now.  She does seem to like the nipple shape and the air stays out of the tip.  The only drawback is that they leak and squeak loud if you tighten the cap too tight.  Overall, we are very happy with the Avent bottles and nipples, I probably wouldn't buy anything else.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Yeah, they do leak sometimes, but to me it's no big deal.  Yes, there doesn't seem to be a pattern, but again, it doesn't happen frequently enough to really wig me out.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have read the past few reviews given for these bottles and I wonder if we are talking about the same bottles.  I too breastfeed and pump. I have tried the Dr. Brown bottles and the Evenflo Ventair bottles and have to say that none of them can even come close to these bottles.  I am yet to see one drop of milk drip out of the bottle.  Maybe the ladies are not assembling the bottle tops correctly!LOVE THEM!,5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I like the avent bottles a lot... the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in, without getting it all over the counter.  I don't think these bottles seem to help my son with gas, he's just a baby, and they are generally gassy.  The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first.  Overall I've been pretty happy with them though, I've never contempated switching.**I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles... My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz, so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles, we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle.  I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I registered for these bottles because all of my friends recommended them. My 3 week old daughter has difficutly with these bottles because the formula just pours out the sides of her mouth. She used the Stage 1 nipple and they are too fast for her. We tried the Playtex Ventaire- she latched on well to those but they caused too much gas. She cried in pain. Today I'll be making a trip to purchase Dr. Brown's bottles to see how they work...,3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,This bottle was a life saver.  I didn't think anything about the leaking because babies are washable.  I was able to put her ceral in the bottle before bed time and the hole house got a good nights sleep.  My daughter has less gas and is happy when I put fruit and other things in this bottle.  It's just a wonderful bottle.,4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using Avent bottles for 5 months and was unaware of any problems with leakage until I read these reviews. I purchased the breast pump pack with bottles in Australia, where I'm from, and used them several times a week when I needed someone else to feed my baby breast milk. My breast milk became ineffective after 4 months so I am using the bottles full time to feed my baby formula and still have never experienced leakage. I've also purchased bottles from here in the U.S. and still had no problems. I'll admit too that I'm not a good one for reading instructions so after sterilising the bottles they are sometimes assembled dry and sometimes wet...I didn't know it made a difference (obviously it doesn't). Mine have always been hand washed though. I don't like to put them in the dishwasher. From someone who breastfed for 4 months before putting my baby onto formula I find the Avent nipples excellent and simulate a real nipple very well. My baby's lips sit over and under the rounded part of the nipple just as they did on my breast. My baby also has trouble bringing up wind but the problem is nowhere near as bad when he uses the Avent nipples as I've been able to control the flow with their numbered system....he takes in nowhere near as much air as a nice slow flow prevents him from having to gulp quickly. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Avent bottles.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been nursing and am now switching our daughter to abottle.  We've tried several different bottles and these were the ones my daughter will take.  We have a terrible time with them leaking.  Breastmilk is like gold to me and its very frustrating when I pull the bottle out of the diaper bag with half of it all over the bag!!  We are currently trying different brands again.,2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Just when you least expect it for no obvious reason these bottles leak.  And by leaking I mean leak A LOT.  A lot of milk dribbles out...down your arm, onto your lap...all over your chair.  It's really annoying, especially since these bottles are NOT cheap.  You'd think they could design them better than this!  And after awhile, just when you forget how much they leak...bam!  It happens again.  This is the second time I've used these bottles (I kept them for my second child because they cost so much I didn't want to replace them) and the leaking has annoyed me so much that I was inspired to get online and post this review!  You'd think after all this time I would have figured out how to keep them from leaking, but no, there's no rhyme or reason to it.  I would strongly recommend another brand.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"very leaky...when you call they dont ake the situation any better. They say it's do to washing bottles with anti bacterial soap, etc. botto line these bottles stink and they are expensive. Don't bother!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I registered for these bottles because I got the manual breast pump from Avent.  The breastpump was phenominal but trying to feed my baby with these bottles, whether using breastmilk or formula, was impossible.  The nipples get clogged and my son got frustrated from sucking so much.  Also, they leaked every where, whether from saking them to mix the formula or just by feedin the baby, they always leaked.  I wish I could get my money back.  I went and bought Gerber bottles, which work perfectly!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Come on now, ladies...As a mom of 4, 41 years old, former child care provider, I have dealt with a lot of bottles. I can tell you that if you screw the lid on ANY bottle too tight, it IS going to leak. Solution? Shake the bottle well before popping it into your dear one's little mouth. If it should leak, loosen it, and screw it on again, do a test shake, and you're off! We recently adopted two little ones (my older ones are 11 and 9, the little onesare  22 months and 5 months), and my youngest is the first baby I've fed exclusively with a bottle. I have been very pleased with the ease of use of the Avent bottles, especially with how easy they are to clean.",5,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Plain and simple - these bottles leak!  I wish I read the reviews before buying these Avent bottles.  My husband and I knew nothing about bottles so when our baby arrived 3 weeks early, we didn't get to research and quickly bought these. I bought several of them and when they leaked thought maybe there was just a bad one in the batch.  Every time one leaked, I removed it from the rotation.  Well, they all eventually leaked so I can't stand them; it's very aggravating.  I've since bought the Dr. Brown bottles and have had no problems with them.  I even think my baby is less gassy and spits up less with the Dr. Brown bottles.  People complain about the extra parts to clean of the Dr. Brown bottles, but that's less of a pain than having the Avent bottles leak all over you and the baby and wasting formula.  I'm going to write to Avent and see if I can get my money back.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Yes, we too have experienced leaks with the Avents.  We've tried to figure it out- Is it the plastic ring?  Is the nipple fully inserted?  Is it not screwed on properly?  Is it a combo of all of these things?  Should it REALLY be this difficult????  I've had Avents leak all inside my diaper bag (didn't realize it until I smelled the sour formula), all down my sons chin and neck, and all over the floor.  We still use ours because I hate to waste money, but we have thrown a few away thinking THEY were the faulty ones... only to have other faulty ones crop up.  (My husband refuses to use the Avents now and only uses Dr. Browns.)  I think it may be a combo of the Avent nipple not sealing (make sure you really, really insert it well), and the ring not being screwed on right (check and double check), but in the end it's like that one sock that always gets lost in the dryer.  What could be the mystery problem??",3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Do NOT buy these bottles!!  Save yourself from a lot of stress & frustration!!  Our Avent bottles leaked all the time & our daughter had a lot of gas.  I called Avent customer service to find out how I could get my money back & they were extremely rude to me.  I very politely explained my problem with the bottles & the customer service representative immediately got a rude tone with me and said """"There is nothing I can do for you - we do not give refunds.  The problem is not with our bottles - you just are not using them properly.""""",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Many people complain about leaking and I must admit that it happened to me a few times too. So to prevent it from leaking I would screw on the top as tight as I could, and it would still leak. So that's when I figure it out.If you screw on the top too tight it will leak.Im telling you that this is true. My bottles have not leaked once since I figured this out. Just tighten it until it just first feels tight, and it will not leak.Saying that, I absolutly LOVE these bottles. The wide mounth is easy to clean. It's easy to figure out which size nipples to use as the baby outgrows them. And if your breast feeding, they have everything you need and it all works right with the bottles. No extra work! I highly recomend these.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,My son is 2 1/2 months old. We never have problems with our Born Free bottles but noticed that he cries and has stomach problems after being fed with the Avent bottles.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I've used Avent bottles for all my kids and have been the happiest with them.  The wide neck allows for easy cleaning which is incredibly important.  I like that when I can't nurse baby I know that they have a bottle that is shaped more like what they are used to, making it a pleasant feeding experience rather than a frustrating one.  I did have problems with the bottles leaking when I first started using them, which turned out to be from over tightening the caps on them...once that was fixed we had no more problems.  Great bottles!!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I would give this system 0 stars if it would let me! I have the whole system, bottles, pump, warmer, pacifiers, you name it. My son hates the pacifiers, newborn size is not large enough to stay in his mouth and next size gags him. They are a bad design overall. The Nuk pacifiers are much better. They are softer and they conform to his face better. The nipples leak like crazy and the milk comes out of the newborn nipples WAY too fast. My son gags on that long hard nipple and then he gulps for air as the milk is being sprayed down his throat. It came out so fast that he would be drenched in milk within seconds of giving him the bottle. They also give him horrible air bubbles. He ends up spitting up a substantial portion of everything he takes in. We stopped using them and got the Playtex nurser with drop ins and he is much happier. The nipple on the playtex nurser is (contrary to Avent advertising) MUCH more like my nipple than the Avent nipple. It is soft and pliable and it sticks out only when he sucks on it-unlike the avent nipple that juts out permanently. Also, the bags on the disposable nurser leak. Their seams are very weak and would leak through both layers even when we double-bagged them. Avent has great advertising-that is about the only thing great about it.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter was a month early and I am having problems breast feeding so I got these bottles with special ""newborn"" nipples.

I have found Avent bottles are simpler to put together with fewer parts to assemble...  However, I try not to use them for night feedings because they sometimes make loud squeaky noises as the air flows into the vents...  This unexpected noise has scared my baby on occasion when very quiet through the night...  Otherwise, one of the easiest to use ventilated bottles...

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased these bottle after trying the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which I did not like.  While these bottles did reduce my baby's gassiness and feeding time, they constantly leak.You wouldn't think it would take a brain surgeon to screw the nipple/cap onto the bottle and not have it leak.  But the majority of the time, the formula leaks from the bottle. In the beginning my baby was wearing as much of the formula as he was eating.  I now find myself screwing, re-screwing and re-screwing the cap and holding it upside down over the sink as a test to see if the bottle leaks.  And then, just when you think it's safe,..lookout, the dreaded drip is back.  The last thing you want to do when you have a hungry and screaming baby is waste time testing the bottle to see if it's leaking.  And, it's not just me who has a problem with the bottles,--I know two other moms who have encountered the same problem.  Save yourself the aggrevation and buy another bottle system.This one has a MAJOR design flaw.",2,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!! We tried the Playtex Brand. We tried the Johnson's Brand.  He still got gas after feeding.  I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work. He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!! Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas.  Thanks Avent!  To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum. It's the bum on the bottle. You're feeding him wrong. To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say:  Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out?  Nipples do get clogged you know.  It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean.  Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple.  You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby.",5,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been using these bottles since my son was 3 wks old. We tried every bottle on the market and this is the one he liked.  It was so much like my breast it made switching between the 2 much easier.  But now he drinks formula all the time about 8oz at a time and it is crazy that at 4:00 in the morning I have to stop everything to change him and that makes him even more upset! I know how to screw the top on and I think it is crazy that you have to pay almost $5.00 a bottle and that you have to go through all these things to stop them from leaking!  He also has acid reflux and I thought this would be a great bottle to help with that.  Now I am learning from my mistakes! Were trying to get him to accept a new bottle and it is so hard because the avent bottles is all he wants now! I don't care what anyone says don't use these bottles unless you want more milk on you and your baby than in the bottle! It's crazy they should fix the problem and it's their problem to fix not the parents!! Come on now $5.00 a bottle! I have 12/ 4oz bottles 9/ 9oz bottles that is a lot of money down the drain!!!!!!!,1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We are very pleased with our Avent purchases.  We have no leakage problems and these wide bottles are easy to wash.  I am not sure if other systems have this, but Avent has &quot;adjustable flow&quot; nipples.  These nipples have 3 settings for flow, depending on how you hold the bottle.  So, when our baby grows and needs more flow, we don't have to buy new nipples or poke new holes.  Avent also has a small microwave sterilizer that can sterilize 4 bottles at a time...we use it all the time for bottles, pacifiers, etc.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles came recommended to me, and I am glad I invested the money.  There is a reason why the Avent bottles are a little more expensive than competitors.  I'm a breasfeeding mother, however, when my son turned four weeks old, we wanted to introduce a bottle so his father and other family members could feed him, giving me a break.  He took to it right away, and I note that he latches on the Avent nipple like that of mine.  So, if you are a breasfeeding mother who wants to use a bottle part-time, then these should be your choice!  I also don't see my son having a lot of gas issues, and they clean up real easy, too--not like some of the bottles my friends have used.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I love the Avent bottles!This is my second child, so I have tried multiple products on the market.  What benefits are heads above the other bottles in my experience include...-- my little guy can manage the wider nipple much more easily with much less air intake than the traditional narrow nipple (we actually use a combination of breast feeding and the Avent bottles without any signs of him being confused or wanting to give up the breast)-- the nipples are durable compared to the Evenflo nipples I used with my first child, so I have not been faced with the problem of constant replacement-- the wider, shorter bottle design keeps the bottle itself from tipping over whether you are using the 4 or 9 ounce size-- the wider bottle design is easier for my little guy to grab onto.  This is a good step toward self-help skills.  I have even started using the sippy cup handles with some bottle feedings to help us move forward into that new world more smoothly.To address the leaking complaint from some reviewers...No matter what bottle you choose, you will have leaking if you do not put it together in a way that works with that system.I was rarely having a leaking problem and found a tip from another reviewer that solved the mystery of the occasional leaker... wet the base of the nipple before assembling the bottle.As a busy mom, I found myself only occasionally putting together bottles after all parts were dry - on those occasions we had leaking.  However, the leaking was pretty minor and easily corrected by unscrewing, wiping the bottle and inner part of the ring, and rescrewing.  After reading this tip about wetting the nipple base with water before assembly, we have been leak free!Now we're looking forward to graduating up to the Avent sippy cups in a couple of months.  Good luck to you in whatever system you find works for your child's healthy eating.",5,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are wonderful! I breastfed and bottle fed my daughter from the begining.  She didn't have any problem with nipple confusion at all, but as she got a little older, she didn't know how to suck on the regular nipples.  I was using Evenflo Sensitive Response nipples.  So, when I bought the Isis pump, I found my daughter LOVED these bottles.  She knew right away how to suck on them, and unlike the Evenflo nipples, the milk did not run all down her chin.  I like the fact that I can pump both sides using one bottle, unlike with the 4 oz. bottles, where I have to switch for each side.

We have never had trouble with leaking like others have said.  The bottles are somewhat more expensive, but worth the extra cost.  One piece of advice.....If your child nurses, there is no need to change the nipples to the faster flows as they get older.  We changed nipples to the slow and medium flow and it was too fast for her (I wish someone would have told me this before we bought all the other nipples).  We are switching back to the newborn nipples (see AVENT web-site for this info).

They have been wonderful for her spit up issues and they are easy for both her and I to hold.  Let me start by saying I was very hesistant about buying this bottle due to the bad reviews about it leaking.  I have not had this problem.  I have found (another user posted this and it works) that you should always assemble the nipple and the ring whilst wet and when you are screwing the ring on to the bottle, give it a counter clockwise turn until you hear it ""click"" into place and then proceed to turn it clockwise until closed.  Also, do not tighten it down like Heman would.  You just need it to be closed and sealed.  Another thing that made my purchase worry free was the fact that I bought them from Babies R Us and told them of my concerns and they told me if the bottles leaked, I could bring them back with my receipt.  All in all, these bottles are great and we have not had one problem.  I will use these with any subsequent babies as well.",5,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Before my son was born, I spent a lot of time reading the reviews on the different feeding systems.  Because we live on a small base in Germany, we do not have a wide selection available to us at out Post Exchange.  I bought a few bottles from the PX and tried them out, but he didn't like any of them.  They would allow the milk to dribble down his face or not enough milk would come out and frustrate him.I bought a single Avent bottle... they were the most expensive and I was hesitant to invest so much money on the Avent system.  I followed the directions (something that a few of the other commenters are obviously not doing) and this bottle worked the best.I have bought a ton of Avent products and they all work fine!

AVENT's website even has a section on how to prevent the bottles from leaking. You want to know why?  Because they leak.  AVENT bottles must be the poorest designed product we have used in the past year.  They leak, and they leak.  They leak at the worst times, they leak and the best.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.

Our oldest models show very little wear - a testament to the quality of the product.Nipples come in a variety of flows (beware the multi-flow, however) and Avent even has a sippy-cup attachment to use later when our baby starts drinking juice.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Boy, were we wrong.  I chose these bottles based on glowing recommendations from my veteran-parent friends who had no feeding issues with any of their babies.  Add to that the literature that promises that Avent bottles are great for transitioning breast-fed babies back and forth from breast to bottle and that they reduce the colic and gas in babies.  With all that, who could go wrong, right?  So we registered for multiple Avent products and seriously stocked up when our generous family and friends shopped off our registries.  Then along came our son.  From the start, he was fussy during and after feedings with Avent bottles and would take only about an ounce per feeding even as he grew in age and size; then he would scream and cry for a long time as if he were both angry and in terrible pain.  Classic colicky baby, right?  We struggled for about 2 months with these bottles and finally gave up.  A friend had given us her daughter's Dr. Brown bottles to try and up until that point, I refused to use them because they were so complicated with all those parts; we were so glad we did finally try them because almost instantly, our son doubled his milk intake, burped less, cried less, and smiled more.  This led to better sleeping and overall household peace.  Our daycare caregivers couldn't be happier either because they had to put up with all his fussing and screaming.  So given the choice to do it again, I would save the frustration and misery and register for a bunch of Dr. Brown bottles because they've saved my sanity and really improved my son's quality of life.

I choose the bottle and my son had no problems at all. He was so happy, I started to pump more and use the Advent bottles more and more. The four ounce bottles are great for little ones.

We did have a lot of issues with the bottles leaking and found that having to change nipple sizes was a bit annoying.  A variable flow nipple would have been much easier than having to switch between nipples with different numbers of holes.  These were much easier to use than the Avent disposable bottles, which tended to leak and didn't allow me to push the air out.  Our son was able to hold these bottles by himself when he was about 6 months old, so that was a real benefit, and we also used the sippee adaptor on them which really extended the life of the bottle!",3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"A nurse at the hospital recommended these bottles to us after I had my daughter.  They worked great for a few weeks, but then they started to leak.  When they leak, you can take off the lid and rub your finger around the inside of the rim to strengthen the seal.  It stops it from leaking, but it's a hassle.  Being a first time mom, I thought perhaps this was a problem with all bottles, but my sister uses playtex bottles and has never had a problem.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have read other reviews about the Avent bottles, and I have to say that we have experienced no problems whatsoever with these bottles. Our son is now almost 6 months old, and the one time we experienced a leaking problem is when the lid was put on crooked. Also, I have never had a problem with them smelling like plastic or with the measurement lines fading. After nearly six months of use, these bottles have been dropped, washed, sterilized, soaked and put in the dishwasher, and we still have no complaints. Also, they are super easy to clean due to the larger opening at the top. We are so happy with the Avent bottles that we have even saved them for use with our future children. The only knock I give is for the 4 oz. bottles. I wish I would have bought only 9 oz. bottles because my son graduated past the 4 oz. mark quickly, and I feel that even purchasing the smaller bottles was a waste of money. Overall, I highly recommend the Avent bottles, but again, I would recommend only buying 9 oz. bottles.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used these bottles with my first child.  I noticed they leaked occasionally which was frustrating, but I refused to buy a whole new bottle system when my second child came along.  I had about 17 bottles and liked having so many. I've been reading the reviews of how to keep it from leaking, and am going to try the advice of  Sherri M. Cottle Chelsea, Alabama) Her review says she called the 1800 number to avent and was told what to do. You have to put the nipple in the white ring and then put the cap on that and then you put that on the bottle and tighten it by the CAP..not the white ring...If you tighten it with the clear platic cap the white ring will stop when its tight enough on its own, preventing the leakage. She swears this works!After having to repack my diaper bag several times b/c of leaky bottles, I've learned to put the bottles in a ziploc bag.  Then if it leaks, you don't have a messy, wet bag!  (I like to put water in the bottle and carry 3 bottles in a large ziploc zipper bag and carry the formula in a dispenser.)As far as colic, both my children weren't colicy.  They were occasionally gassy.  My sister-in-law gave me the advice to put a couple of Mylecon (or I used little tummies b/c it's cheaper)drops in each bottle to ""get rid of the bubbles"".  I did this with both of my children the first few months.  It worked for me.Also, for the relief of my children's occasional gas, a friend recommended Baby's Bliss Gripe Water.  I googled it and purchased it off of the internet.  It's an herbal supplement used to ease the gas & stomach discomfort often associated with colic, hiccups, and teething.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are the worst bottles because of the leaking!! They leak all over you and the baby no matter how the lid is put on, AND you shouldn't even have to worry about if you even put the lid on so precisly right.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used these bottles when I decided to supplement with formula at 3 weeks.  My daughter didn't really have any problems switching back and forth between the breast and bottle.  She is completely weaned at this point and doing well with these bottles.  I am glad I decided to go with the 9 oz bottles from the start, as she quickly went from 4 oz to 6 oz and I would have had to buy new bottles if i had originally purchased the 4 oz bottles.  We had some minor problems with leaks, and then I actually read the instructions that came with the bottles.  The secret is to reassemble the nipple/ring while the nipple and ring are still wet.  That seemed to solve our leaking problems.  I would highly recommend these bottles to anyone.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"this bottle started out ok until after about 5 months of usage, it started leaking around the collar no matter how tight the collar was screwed on.  this was so annoying, especially at night when you are sleepy.  you have to remove the collar and nipple, put it back on, turn it upside down and pray that this time it wont leak (after going through this a few time you will want to throw the bottle into the wall).  eventually you will get lucky and the bottle wont leak but for the next feeding you go through this process all over again.  try the playtex disposable nurser (the drop in liner is fabulous), buy the one with the avent-like nipple.  so far this is excellent, no leaks and no wash.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I do not know what the problem is with so many of the reviewers' bottles here, but I have been using the Avent system EXCLUSIVELY since my son was born 4 weeks ago and they have NEVER ONCE LEAKED!  I can only say to prospective buyers that you should TRY the bottles first before making your decision.  My son LOVES the Avent bottles and goes from bottle to breast with absolutely NO NIPPLE CONFUSION.  I LOVE them!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have used three different bottle for my 3 month old son now.  He gets horrible gas and avent bottles are supposed to help with that, but for me they dont. ALso they leak all the time.  The only good thing about them is that unlike the plytex bottles i use now, the avent bottles have several stages of nippples so there is always one that is the perfect speed for your baby.  Personally i have had more luck with the playtex ventaire bottles and the playtex nursers.  They allow less air to get in babys belly, but they only 2 nipple stages, fast and slow. Its good to register for several differnt bottles and let your baby decide which ones are right for them!",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used these bottles with my little sister 6 years ago, & I started my son on them (with breastmilk) from birth.  It's very easy for them to go from breast to bottle, I loved the pop-in cap for storage, and ALL Avent pieces are interchangeable!! I had to switch to Dr. Brown's recently because my baby has severe gas problems, but I would have stayed with Avent except for that. They're so easy to clean because of the wideness.P.S. As for everyone complaining they leak, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I read a recent review saying she didn't know why they left room between the threads that screw on the cap & nipple, the bottle info explicitly says this is to let air vent out, that is why they leak when you screw the cap on too tight. It just takes a light twist & it's on. If you've got a really gassy baby, go with Dr. Brown, otherwise, these are awesome for the breastfed baby!",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased these bottles after hearing how wonderful they were. I breastfed my daughter for her first year, so we didn't use them that often. When she was weaned, and started on formula we started having problems. Everytime my husband or I would screw on the ring, milk poured out everywhere! There was no right way to screw the damn rings on... it was just pure luck, and it took numerous times each feeding to get it on right. The milk would pour out from underneath the ring (not from the nipple). My first thought was that I just got a bad batch... but I had bought them at different times, then I thought that the dishwasher was somehow warping them. Well, if that's the case then forget about Avent!! I don't have the time to handwash all her bottles, and if I did find the time, I still wouldn't.I read through the reviews to see if it was just me... I found many reviews just like mine. Then I found myself laughing at the reviews that instruct you on how to create the perfect seal. I gotta tell you, I put up with these stupid bottles for far too long, and they are expensive, so I held off on buying new ones. It felt so good to throw these in the trash. There is no need to have to spend the time on the ""perfect seal"", when there are other brands that work so much better! We finally threw them all out and bought another brand, Soothie, so far have been wonderful!Don't waste your money on this brand.*The sippy cups are just as bad. I've forgotten about them several times, and they've tipped on their side inside her diaper bag and they leak even with the lids on tight.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have a 6 week old daughter and have tried using the Avent bottle to supplement breast feedings.  Unfortunately, I have found this bottle to be worthless for anything except storing pumped breast milk.  It is extremely difficult for my daughter to suck anything out of this nipple.  I too have found leakage from the nipple ring, making for a very sloppy feeding session.  I have since bought and used the Playtex VentAire bottles and haven't had any difficulties.  The shape of the Playtex VentAire bottles are also much easier for feeding.  I would not reccomend the Avent to anyone unless their baby has an impressively strong suck.",2,191,1.620650696503464

When I contacted avent, they  told me that if the bottles are over tightened or if the nipple isn't assembled with the cap when it was wet that the will leak. I don't know about you but a 2am I don't want to be changing my two week old because her bottle leaked all over her. Please keep this in mind when looking at bottles.",1,191,1.620650696503464

I find that if the seal between the nipple & the bottle is not right, then you will get a leak.  I solve this problem by just unscrewing the nipple/lid and then rescrewing it on SLOWLY so I know it is getting a good tight even seal.  This always works!",5,191,1.620650696503464

I think the bottles have something to do with this.  UPDATE...  After using these a year now I can say the fix-all is indeed not to overtighten the lid.  I read later it distorts the silicon of the nipple causing the leak.  Once I figured that out, I quit hurling them leaking and full against the wall.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really like the Avent bottles better than others.  My baby had difficulty with breastfeeding and had to use a breast shield, so he was used to the plastic.  When we decided to try a bottle for wee hour feedings, we tried Playtex, but he didn't like the flat nipples, and I don't think he liked the latex taste very much.  My lactation consultant suggested Avent because of the silicone newborn nipples.  We used this, and once he got used to having a bottle at night, he took right off.  The nipples still require the baby to suck pretty hard without just pouring out, so I didn't have as hard a time with him going back to breast during the rest of the day as I did with other brands.  Also, we enjoy the Avent Bottle/Baby Food Warmer.  All in all, I think these are superior to the others on the market.",4,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used Dr. Brown bottles for our first and switched to Avent around 11 mos or so with him.  Our second is now 11 weeks old and has been using Dr. Browns.  I was so tired of cleaning all of the parts and thought I would try the Avents.  The box boasted about new sofeter nipples, which I remebered being the difficulty with our first when we tried them.  I thought ""great!"" and purchased them.  Unfortunately our 11 week did not agree and they are anything but soft!  It is difficult for young babies to suck because it does not collapse enough.  The shape also caused him to gulp a lot of air.  I guess I will have to succumb to the bottle washing schedule I was trying to avoid with the Dr. Browns because they really did work.  By the way, the wide mouth bottles made by Dr. Browns worked better regarding the shape of the nipple & the nipples are much softer than the Avent.  I still think the traditional shaped Dr. Browns work best though.These bottles (Avents) also leak when they end up on their side in the diaper bag.

Then I would have to stop feeding, take off the cap, put on the nipple cover and put back on the bottle in order to get it closed just right again.  The only reason I tried them was because I needed a wide mouth bottle with a medium flow nipple.  These are definately not worth the money. If I could, I would rate them a negative 10.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Okay bottles. I haven't found anything that I like better yet, but I am still looking.These bottles do leak. I realize that it is because of over/under tightening. However, I am the only one in our family that can tighten them correctly. My husband, mom, and sister all cannot get them tightened properly. This morning my husband tried to retighten it 5 times before he finally woke me up and had me do it. Our car has stains from other people mixing a bottle. I find that unacceptable for a pricey bottle. No other bottles leak like this. My sister-in-law just gave me all her Avents because she is so sick of it.Also, my daughter (8 mos) is still on the smallest size nipple because when we switched to the bigger ones, she had a puddle of milk behind her head. We have tried increasing the size since then and had the same problem. But she is a fast eater, she can suck down an 8 ozer in 10 mins or less!In spite of the leaks and the weird nipple problem, I continue to use them because other bottles have other problems. Maybe I am too picky, but we can't find one we like.My baby also spits up a ton and also several hours later. We have tried other bottles and other formulas.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Everyone told me that these were ""the"" bottles.  So, we bought newborn as well as the 9 and 11 oz sets.  Here were the problems with these bottles/nipples:1. Nipples are too long and too tough...the baby would almost gag on the nipple when feeding and would fall asleep quickly because she was having to work too hard.2.  The bottles had a vacuum effect - every few minutes I would have to unscrew the cap and screw it back on to stop the vacuum effect, which would stop the milk flow from the nipple.  Every time I had to re-screw on the cap, milk would start leaking.  I followed the directions exactly and did not over tighten the cap, but still the problem persisted.3. The nipple flow was too slow or too fast.  My newborn couldn't get anything from the newborn nipples and would fall asleep from exhaustion.  We then went with the next size up (faster) and that worked.  Once she outgrew that speed, and needed the level 2 and 3, they were too fast.  There was no inbetween.4. The nipple flow rates work differently on each sized bottle.  I don't know what causes this, but she was able to eat with the 2 flow nipple on the 4 ounce bottles, but when she needed more food, and we tried the 2 flow nipple on the 9 ounce bottle, the 2 nipple flowed too slowly.Overall, my experience with these bottles was exasperating.  I felt like I was a ""sucker"" for falling for the latest fad.  I then went to the store and bought one of every bottle out there.  She went for the Playtex Nurser with the latex nipple (they are softer and more flexible) and has loved it ever since.  Haven't had any problems what-so-ever and finally feeding is a happy experience.One thing I can say is that the Avent bottles with the wide neck are perfect for mixing formula in.  We actually mix the formula in the Avents with a hand mixer and then pour the formula into the Playtex.  Also, we can use the Avent bottles with the sippy cup conversion pieces, so the money we spent on the bottles isn't a total loss.  We now have more sippy cups than we could ever possibly want or use!",1,191,1.620650696503464

TIP FOR NEW MOMS: I thought I was done using the 4 oz bottles when he graduated to the 9 oz, but the smaller ones are good to keep on hand when baby is learning to hold the bottle on his own. The 9 oz tends to be too heavy for him to keep hold of, but he has no problem clutching the 4 oz - so I just make 2 for him :)(Also, buy EXTRA nipples! It really makes life easier. Stage 1-2 should last you a while. The Stage 3 nipples seem to run too fast for him still, even though my son is 6 months and is quite a hefty eater).",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really do like these bottles. No annoying bags, or gummy nipples. They must be put together when wet though, or else they leak. It's no different than a manual breast pump..they need a wet seal. I wash them, then pop nipple through ring while wet. When I'm ready to fill the bottles, I run hot water over the ring/nipple and then assemble (not over tightening). I wash mine by hand (Pediatrician advised against dishwasher). I replace the nipples every couple of months, and I sterilize every few weeks to get rid of any build up.",4,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These bottles are fantastic at preventing gas in my son but occassionally they leak. I tried to be proactive against the leaks by making sure both the nipple and plastic ring are tight but they sometimes leak all over the place for no apparent reason.,4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown.""  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have given this product 2 stars.  It might be a fab bottle for you, but personally it was a nightmare for us.  Just make sure you have other bottles on hand, in the event your little one doesn't like Avent.  For the 1st 6 months of my daughter's life, feeding was a horrible experience.  The nipples are pricey & don't fit any other bottle.  My daughter got to the point where she wouldn't nurse from a bottle.  I ran out & bought some cheaper nipples & bottles and finally found one she would take.Yes, the nipple on the Avent bottle is more like a mommy's and baby does have to work harder to get the formula or breast milk out.  But there are other brands out there that are just as good (I personally think) than Avent.  If you want to be trendy...go ahead & spend the money. Just make sure you've got those other bottles ready, just in case.  I wish we had!!!",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are absolutely the best!  My baby used Medela, Healthflow and bottles given to us from the hospital and was gassy all the time! Then we tried the Avent bottles and it worked great!  No gas for the baby and slow flow cause I'm still breastfeeding.  I would recommend this item to all new mothers. If you have problems with the bottle leaking, you have screwed the cover on too tight.  I had to do some research on why it leaked and was glad.  Also the Avent Isis pump is great too!  I like that it is quiet, only regret I wish it was electric.  I have an electric Medela pump but still prefer the Avent Isis.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I can't even tell you how relieved I was to find the Avent bottle after my daughter was born!  I had purchased the Playtex bottles prior to her birth (despite all of the negative reviews) and found that all of the complaints were true- my daughter was unable to get any milk out of the nipples because the holes were so tiny and the bottles had so many different parts that needed to be cleaned.  After trying several different kinds of bottles, I tried the Avent brand.  She IMMEDIATELY took to this bottle and never had any problems with them thereafter.  She loved her bottle and it ended up being the 2nd word that she said!  I am so thankful for this product!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"(This is a long review, but if you read the whole thing it may save you some money and frustration. If you just want to read the bit about the Bottles, jump down to the 6th Paragraph and read from there)I used Avent products with my first child (5 years ago!) and was absolutely thrilled. Back then, I was a solo-mother on welfare, so the cost was a real struggle for me, but I was so thrilled with the product that I found the money to buy the things I needed for my child.Five years on, and oh how things have changed. This time around I am married and have the funds to be able to buy whichever brand I want, without money being a consideration. So, I eagerly stocked up on all things Avent. I bought the 4 oz bottles, 9 oz bottles, disposable bottle kit, Isis Electric Breast Pump, pacifiers, Bottle & Food Warmer, Bottle Tote, Formula Dispeser, Microwave Steam Steriliser ... the whole shebang!The first thing to go wrong was the Isis Breast Pump ($US150 from Babies'R'Us). It would work fine for anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes, and then the suction would slack off and the rhythm would go out of whack, stopping the flow of milk from my breast. I would then have to turn off the machine and pump manually instead, or be left only partially expressed. I was reliant on the pump to take off my milk, as my baby would not latch, and I really wanted to keep giving her breast milk. When the machine broke down I contacted Avent and asked for a refund, as I was going to have to replace the machine. Avent told me that it was a non-refundable item, but if I waited a week they would send out a label for me to ship the pump back to them and then IF THEY FOUND A FAULT they would then repair it and return it to me. They said it would take 2-4 weeks. And what was I to do without a breast pump for a month, I asked??! The lady on the phone suggested that I purchase their manual pump to use in the meantime, and boasted that it would only cost me about $US50. Needless-to-say, I lost a lot of money on this, and was absolutely furious!! I threw the worthless pump in the trash and ended up 100% formula-feeding my baby.Then there were issues with some of the nipples tearing, and they were less than a month old. I figured this was just my misfortune, so rather than make a fuss about it, I simply replaced the nipples at my own expense.Next came the distorted bottles. I noticed one day that the plastic of one of the 4 oz bottles was warped. I thought it a little odd, but again thought that I had probably just caught a wonky batch and didn't think too much about it. Then another bottle warped, and another, and another, and another ... fairly soon I had 5 warped bottles (some 4 oz, some 9 oz). Enough was enough! I called Avent again and complained, only to have the woman on the phone tell me that I mustn't have read the instrustions on the MICROWAVE STEAM STERILISER properly. The woman asked me to confirm the wattage of my microwave, the amount of time I was putting the bottles in for, and how much water I was using (900W, 5 minutes, 200 mls). After telling her, she confirmed that yes, that was all correct, but she still said that I must have been doing something wrong during the sterilising process.The lady sent me out a label to send the bottles back to them for 'testing'. She said that once the bottles had been tested then they would get back to me. Well, while waiting for the label to arrive, I ensured that I absolutely was following the instructions correctly when I used the Steriliser, but I still managed to have two more bottles warp on me, giving me a total of 7 warped bottles to return!!I finally got the label and sent the bottles back. About a week later Avent called and said that the tests showed I had ""overloaded"" the Steriliser, and that had caused the bottles to warp. She said that ""as a one-off courtesy"" they would replace the five 9oz bottles. I pointed out to her that I had stacked the Steriliser as told to do so in the illustrations of the instruction booklet, and when I asked about the two 4 oz bottles I had also returned, she denied that they had received them (even though I put them all in the package myself!!) and refused to discuss the matter any further. So, I have lost 2 bottles, and have a steriliser that apparently likes to melt bottles regardless of how cautious I am about follwing the directions.The other things I have had issues with are the pacifiers and the Bottle Tote. The pacifiers had a hard edge on the silicone, which was very uncomfortable for my newborn. I ended up replacing these with a different brand, as Avent wanted me to return the pacifiers to them at my own expense before they would consider replacing them. The Bottle Tote packaging states that it will keep bottles warm or cold for ""up to 4 hours"". This is more like ""up to 2 hours"", but even that is dubious. In order to get the bottles hot enough to stay warm for 4 hours, it would have to be boiling water, but if you put boiling water into the bottles, the pressure becomes too much for them to handle, so that's not an option. I have ended up throwing out the Bottle Tote (which cost me $15) and purchasing a mid-size Thermos. (I put the water of about the right temperature into the Thermos and take empty bottles with me. I even use the Thermos at home, so that I do not have to wait for the Avent Bottle Warmer to hurry up and do it's thing at 3am!)I also have the Via Nurser Kit and addtional containers, but have found that the lids sometimes do not seal properly, and therefore leak. Very annoying, especially when you had pre-mixed formula in the container, your baby is hungry, and you're an hour drive from home!I am absolutely disappointed with Avent. Almost every product of theirs that I have purchased this time around has been defective in one way or another, and their cutomer service level has been absolutely pathetic. They have obviously never heard ""the customer is always right"" because the have continually placed the blame solely on me for the issues that I have had.Avent used to be a great company with a great product, and now it seems that they are simply relying on their good reputation of the past to carry them through the future. It's not good enough. Their products are NOT worth the money anymore, and I strongly recommend that no one buy any of their products. There are tons of very good (better!) products available on the market, and I will be replacing all of my Avent equipment with another brand as soon as I can. (I noticed while at Target the other day that Circo are now making 'wide neck bottles' that look exactly like the Avent ones, but at almost half the price ... I think I'll give them a go! Maybe you should too?)",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I recently had a baby boy and I purchased Avent bottles because I heard and read that they caused less air to enter the baby's stomach so I purchased them. I have not been pleased with these bottles because they leak. More milk has spilled on my baby's and my clothes during his feedings and I have never had that experience with any other bottles, therefore I am getting ready to purchase new bottles and they won't be Avent. I would like their customer service number to offically complain.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Now I love them. The only reason I didn't like them at first was that my newborn son was sucking alot of air through the corners of his mouth while using these bottles. I think that the nipples were just too big for him as a newborn. Now that he's 1 month old, we are not having any problems. He has less gas now too since switching back to Avent.I have not had one instance of leaking with these bottles either.",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I should have read the reviews on this bottle before I registered for them.  I too planned on breastfeeding and was told this was the best for switching back and forth between breast and bottle.  I also had to stop breatfeeding and go to the bottle 100%.  I've tried every angle and no matter what these bottles leak like mad.  Most of the formula ends up down the side of my daughters face or in her bib.  Additionally my daughter takes in to much air and has constant issues with gas. I am now looking for a different bottle.  Do your research because it can save you a lot of frustration and money.,2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We switched to these bottles around our son's 4th month - prior to that we were using the Playtex Vent Aire bottles.  Compared to the Playtex, the Avent bottles are MUCH better.  The Playtex bottles have FIVE pieces (nipple, nipple ring, bottle shaft, air filter and screw-on bottom).  Too often, when one of us would shake the Playtex bottle with formula, it leaked and we would have to take the entire bottle apart again to find the leak.  Meanwhile ""The Baby""(tm) cries like he hasn't been fed in four days.The Avent bottles leak every once in awhile when shaken, but I have found the fault is my own - I just don't have the nipple ring tightened completely.  Fortunately its a quick fix and the little nipper is satisfied much faster.  There are only three parts - bottle, nipple and nipple ring (four if you count the bottle cover) - so clean up is SO much easier.  These bottles can be washed in in a jiffy.  Plus, the size is nice - up to 9 oz., depending on what your kid needs/wants.  The size is also nice for holding the bottle - I find they fit nicely in my meaty paws.  Our son likes them too - he can easily hold an Avent with both hands now.  Overall they are nice bottles.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Out of all the bottles on the market, Avent bottles are the easiest to clean because of the wider shape. My baby also seems to be comfortable with drinking from this bottle. The most annoying thing though about these bottles is that they leak.

Aside from the occasional leaks, these bottles are perfect.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are the only ones that I have come across that are great when breastfeeding as well as supplimenting. All the other brands I have tried my son spits up with and then gets confused when it comes time to latch on my breast. These bottles are a god-send to breast and bottle feeding mothers. They are WELL worth the cost, and are durable. They do leak if you don't get the top on perfectly, but nothing a minute of time won't fix. I recommend these bottles to ANY mother who is breast and bottle feeding.",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased the Avent system before the birth of my daughter. These bottles are horrible! Not only did they leak EVERYWHERE, but my daughter spent the first month of life eating every 1-2 hours from these bottles. She would suck and suck, only managing to get an ounce of so from the bottle during an HOUR of feeding! She would tire before her hunger was satisfied. Not only was she exhausted from these results of these bottles, but so was I! I orignally bought them because they seemed as though they were a good quality (hard plastic, etc). WRONG - Never judge a bottle by the appearance. Since this purchase, I've trashed ALL of the AVENT bottles and gone with cheaper (but more efficient) brands, Evenflo and Gerber.",1,191,1.620650696503464

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have never had a problem with the regular bottles leaking.  Now the disposable ones I did BUT the only reason why they did is the fact I used the clear nipples instead of the BLUE flat edge ones that are made to go with the disposable system.  This product saved me with breastfeeding.  My son has had NO problems with nipple confusion and continues to switch between the AVENT bottles and &quot;mom&quot;.  I highly recommend this to any nursing mother and I will use it again with our next child as well!  All the lactation consultants and books say NOT to move off of the newborn or level 1 nipple if you are breastfeeding, the entire time of your nursing experience.  Larger holes in the higher stages could hamper your efforts of nursing.  GOOD LUCK!",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent bottles were recommended to me by my cousin.  She did warn me about the leaking problem with these bottles.  Even when I think I have the cap on correctly, the formula leaks out of the bottle soaking my daughter.  Several times, while in my bottle bag, the formula has seeped out leaving me with an empty bottle and a pool of formula in my bag.......very frustrating and messy!!!  On a happier note, I am also currently using the microwave sterilizer and bottle warmer put out by Avent and I'm quite satisfied with both products.",3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had asked for these bottles when I was pregnant with my son. I ended up breast feeding exclusivly and never ended up using them. I found out that you could buy a """"sippy cup"""" spout to use with them. My now 2 year old uses them daily.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After having 3 kids now ages 9,5 and 2 who all used the Playtex disposable nursers by my 4th I got tired of always running out of the drop ins and realized what an unecessary expense it had become. I also thought my 3 month old daughter was too tiny to be using one of those tall 8 oz bottles, (which is almost as big as her) as opposed to the nice compact design of the Avent nurser. I figured my sister-in-laws all use them and I'd never heard any complaints so I didn't even bother looking at the reviews before purchasing my own. Well I wish I had because now they tell me about the leaks. I'm right there with the other reviewer who said it was &quot;not a leak but a pour&quot; I always double and triple check the nipple and ring before giving my baby the bottle and about 50% of the time either right away or halfway through a bottle it will just start to pour out all over the baby and me. As a mom of 4 it can't be chalked up to inexperience I definitely know what I'm doing. So to those moms who haven't had any problems yet good luck to you, but I just wanted to warn others it might not but it can happen. Just imagine what it's like when you have to take the bottle away from your screaming hungry baby so you can clean up the mess and fiddle with the cap in he middle of a feeding (believe me it is not pleasant!)",3,191,1.620650696503464

I love how you are able to interchange peices for these bottles.  I was able to use the bottles as my son's toddler cups when he outgrew nipples!

At six months, we started using powdered formula and mixing bottles one at a time, as needed.  NO MORE LEAKING!!!

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"This bottle is overall a good purchase although there is a tendacy to leak.  It is best used by breast feeding mothers as a supplement bottle due to the smaller size because you rarely need more than 4 oz for the supplement.  The 9 oz bottle doesn't have any markings for under 2 oz preventing accurate measurement of the childs intake.  As with all baby products, diferent children prefer different things but in my experience this nipple does closer resemble the nipple of a breast and my 2 week old son agrees.

My husband had the same leaking problem mentioned by others, but it's not the bottles.  He was simply overtightening the top of the bottles.  Avent addresses this issue on their website;""Why does my reusable AVENT Bottle sometimes leak?Leaking from underneath the locking ring of the AVENT Bottle most often occurs when the 'skirt' in the base of the AVENT teat is not in the correct position. Try the following steps:Pull the teat through the locking ring until it clicks into place. Then put the dome cap firmly on to the locking ring. Screw the assembled top section onto the bottle.Check that the top section has not been over-tightened. This can distort or trap the anti-colic skirt which will not allow the proper operation of the one-way valve.Wet the base of the teat before pulling the teat through the locking ring. This will ensure that the skirt will slip easily into place inside the neck of the bottle and form a seal.""",5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"As one other reviewer said, they do leak.  We've found that if you unscrew the top and then screw it back on, it will stop leaking.  Other than this, they are great!",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles leak horribly. Yes, I know how to work a bottle. They leak all over the baby. I would recomend Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. So much less air gets in the bottle and the nipples are ideal for switching from breast to bottle. These bottles are supposed to reduce air bubbles? Yeah, right. Do not waste your money.",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The good points...  easy to clean, no stupid liners to deal with, clearly marked nipples, correct measurement marks on bottle sides(surprisingly uncommon)The bad...  impossible to tell if the collar is screwed on correctly, until you shake it and milk gets everywhere, or dumps all over baby during feeding. Also slowest nipple is much faster than playtex or gerber, and tough for slow eaters to get used to.The screw issue makes these useless for me to travel with, as everything gets soaked.  Just a stupid design.",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I registered for the Dr. Brown and Avent bottles for my first baby.  I prefered the shape of the Avent bottles and the shape of the nipple to the long/narrow shape of the Dr. Brown.  And they were easier to clean.  HOWEVER, after several times of formula leaking onto my son's chest and soaking his clothing and neck and hair I started to throw away nipples and caps, thinking they were faulty.  I bought new ones.  Then I learned they leak due to the way they are screwed on.  What a hassle!  I now have twins and use all bottles I own--the Dr. Brown narrows and the Avent leaky's.  I have learned to live with the leaks (I always remember to check them before I give them to the babies).  But, now that Dr. Browns offers the short/wide neck bottles I would recommend them hands down!",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I only had thm leak once when I over tightened the top.  If you read the directions that come with them you won't have a problem.  I also got the sealing disks and use them to transport homemade babyfood to daycare.  You can also get sippy cup adapters...I love that these bottles grow with baby!!,5,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had thought I loved these bottles...but I have never been so dissapointed and frustrated ...2am ,my daughter is completely soaked!!! now she is starving,freezing,being changed and hungry in the middle of the night!!!they leak so much and formula is expensive!!! I want my money back!!!",1,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really like these bottles.  I purchased a couple of these and the Playtex ventaire bottles after deciding buying disposable liners for the playtex disposable was getting expensive.  I like both the ventaire and the Avent bottles.  I have NEVER had a leaking problem with the Avent bottles and the best part is that they don't have as many parts to clean as the ventaire bottles.  I have stopped using the ventaire bottle because the parts are wearing out and beginning to leak... very frustrating.My son had no problem switching from breast to bottle, as I went back to work part-time.  He is now almost 8 months old and these bottles are still holding strong.  I will definitely be using these for our next child...",4,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Just have to let you know... They leak.  My baby is  only two weeks old and these bottles are leaking all over him!!  Poor guy. He ends up wet before he can even burp!!,3,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Not for my unhappy colic infant.  My advice to all moms, try an asortment of brands before stocking up.  I got the starter kit, and it simply is not the bottle for my baby!  And I hate that i can't assemble a bottle at 3am without leaking!",2,191,1.620650696503464
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are the only bottles my daughter wanted to drink from. They have a nice wide neck so it is also easy to clean. I never had a problem with these leaking at all. I also love these bottles for when i would formula feed her. Again because of the wide neck, I never had a problem with any powder spilling all over the place. And the caps stay snugly in place. I also like the fact that they make the nipples with different flows for different ages so i never had a problem with my daughter choking, not getting enough, or getting too little.My daughter is now 14 months old and drinks from a cup. I still have these bottles, and i plan on using them for my son who is due in february.",5,191,1.620650696503464
